# How to: Add or Close Tabs Using Special Buttons in DXTabControl


<p>DXTabControl provides built-in functionality for hiding and adding tabs. This example demonstrates how to add or delete when they are generated from a collection. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To show corresponding buttons, use the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/DevExpressXpfCoreTabControlViewBase_HideButtonShowModetopic">HideButtonShowMode</a> and <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/DevExpressXpfCoreTabControlViewBase_NewButtonShowModetopic">NewButtonShowMode</a> properties. To remove an item from the source collection when a tab is closed, use the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/DevExpressXpfCoreDXTabItem_CloseCommandtopic">CloseCommand</a>. To create a new tab when the add button is clicked, use <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/DevExpressXpfCoreTabControlViewBase_NewTabCommandtopic">NewTabCommand</a>. These commands are automatically executed by TabControl when corresponding actions are performed. <br><br>Please refer to the following article for more details: <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/CustomDocument113904">Adding and Removing Tab Items</a>.</p>
